    <h2> The Amazing Night Fury </h2>
    <p> THe Night Fury is the rarest of all the dragons in all of the viking lands. Before I met Toothless, my Night Fury, I did not know they existed, this is because there is barely no information on the Night Fury Dragon.</p>
    <P> My entire family has always been scared of dragons and thus when I met Toothless I had to keep him a secret. With time, our community of vikings have fallen absolutely in love with dragons </p>
      <p> When we started welcoming dragons to Valhalla, they just could not stop coming back and therefore, we had to move to the Hidden World. This is where we live to date </p>
